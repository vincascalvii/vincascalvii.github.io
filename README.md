# Calvin Lam's Portfolio

A website is the place where people can know more about you and your business. In my projects, I focus on the simplest user interface to bring the easiest user experience possible for the visitors. I love creating things that allow the users to find what they are looking for straight away.

Instead of words alone, how about we dive into the works that I've done?
